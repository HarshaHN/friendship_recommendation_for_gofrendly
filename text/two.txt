Steps:
input: graph, input node features of the users 
(take care of isolated nodes, ).


1. Use algorithm 1 to generate the embedding for a given node. 
2. Train the model, so that the loss minimizes.
3. 

we apply multiple convolutional modules that aggregate feature information from the nodeâ€™s local graph neighborhood.

2.
