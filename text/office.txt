Sub: important (thesis 2020)
Dear colleagues,

I wanted to check what is the possibilities of converting my thesis role into a full-time job. Building a fully-fledge AI model from ground-up usually involves lot of design, experiments from a mid-size team in many companies, I took this solely out of interest as an amibitious project. I personally have spent great zeal and deal of time into this so far with minimum support from the company on the technical aspects.

I understand that this is based on the company needs, availability of funds and my performance. However, your reply shall give me some idea to me to plan my future opportunities in the months to come. I eagerly await for your reply. I am sure there are always some interesting opportunities for talent engineers like me. Lastly, I welcome some feedback/constructive criticism for my own personal development.

Med Vänliga Hälsningar,
Harsha
