1. translate: google translate all user stories.
Avg story length is 400 ch per user - 36 million users * 20$ per million = 720$
conda install -c conda-forge langdetect
pip install spacy-langdetect

Weekly post 09: Apr 10-17, 2020 as follows:
Last weeks progress:
a. Tried to visualize the network using socnetv, gephi and other graph-tools. But none could handle the scale and they all crashed.
b. I tried to try other free popular translate service py-translate, trans but did not work, however, langdetect lib works which can avoid translating stories which are already in English.
c. For the classification task, I discovered that we have a serious data imbalance issue. To evaluate this, I considered 300 users(max trans limit) set. Now the positive samples are just 30 in numbers, blocked users are also few in numbers, however, not-yet friends would be all other combinations which is a large number. As I read multiple strategies to solve, the best one is to use SMOTE(Synthetic Minority Over-sampling TEchnique) with adaboost or gradient boosting but at 38% precision and 28% recall for the minority class.
d. In order to solve the above, I spent time brainstorming new ways to get more numbers of positive and negative samples. Discussed with my friends, listened to a few lectures on how this is solved in other link prediction problems, but less emphasis is given for data handling in these lectures/slides.  I arrived at a new idea and these data points populate positive and negative friendship samples. 
Positive samples: chat friends, mutually connected friends, chat friends of chat friends, activity friends.
Negative samples: blocked friends, Viewed users but not added as friends, one-way added as a friend but not chat friends.
The beauty is that once the model is trained, then remaining not-yet friends(and even not seen) shall be fed and it will fall either in this class.
e. Until above I had only focused on user bio(or stories). However, a profile has more info. I was thinking of including them. For which some more data extraction and data cleansing is needed. I am writing a few more SQL query and python code and get a consolidated list.
f. As mentioned in the thesis proposal, I have a 3.5 credit course running now called 'Global competence'. I have a final project I am working on it parallelly and It will take a few more days to finish. Lastly, I took a day off on Monday as for Easter festivities.
g. Lastly, I came across the step called 'Explorative Data Analysis' which is an essential step taken for any data science projects. It is the first glimpse into the data giving a lot of understanding about the data in place. This is something I read and learnt a bit more in detail. This was not taught at KTH but seen as a best practice.

Discussion:
Nothing I have in mind. 

Next week targets:
a. Prepare train data set, train the classification model for 300 users set.
b. Scale-up to the network to a city, translate using Google API and evaluate on validation set.
