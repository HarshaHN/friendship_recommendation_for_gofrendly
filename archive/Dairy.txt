1. translate: google translate all user stories.
Avg story length is 400 ch per user - 36 million users * 20$ per million = 720$

conda install -c conda-forge langdetect
pip install spacy-langdetect
conda install -c conda-forge google-cloud-translate

2. Elastic search: 
dataframe:
user_id, story_embedd

Meeting 08 - 16.00-17.20 on Apr 10, 2020 and MoM as follows:
Discussion outcomes:
a. Resolution for the two blockers in finishing 'scaleup and train S-BERT model':
    i. Translate 85,000 stories to English and generate S-BERT embeddings. Official Google API is priced at 20$ per million ch translates to 720$ for 85,000 with avg. of 400 ch/user
    ii. Only consider a particular city say Gotheberg users. User count would be less and thus, the cost is significantly reduced. Complete the task for this user set.
    
ii. Given friends list and their stories embeddings, train a classification model to predict link or no link. For this case, we use the existing mutual friends and chat friends as a positive example of friendship. However, the question was what pairs of users to be considered as negative/not-friends samples. We decided to split into 3 categories: friends, not-yet friends and blocked users and train the model accordingly.
b. My supervisor asked me to consider the idea that users would infact like to be friends with users with similar meaning stories called homophily. However, this would be something we can experiment later.

Next week targets:
a. Carry-out translation of user stories.
b. Train the classification model to predict link or no-link.
c. Benchmark the results of this SBERT-model.
z. Simple data visualization of the social network: plan to use SocNetV.
Other available ones are Graph-tool and iGraph, Graphviz, Gephi, Cytoscape, Long tail plot and Gnuplot.

Last weeks progress:
Overall
Sat: Tried to visualize the network using socnetv, gephi and other graph-tools. But none could handle the scale.
Sun: translate, py-translate is deprecated, did not work. langdetect lib works for 1000.
Data prep for classification task. Dealing with data imbalance.
Mon:

Schedule: (I am two weeks behind)

Decision: consider option b, it may cost up to 100-200$ and move ahead.
In Progress:
a. Scaleup and train S-BERT model.
z. Data visualization: Neo4j Labs:
https://neo4j.com/developer/tools-graph-visualization/


Plan ahead (for the rest of the thesis):\
e. Evaluate S-BERT model.
f. Data visualize the S-BERT performance.
g. Implement the GCN.
h. Scaleup and train GCN.
i. Evaluate GCN model.
j. Data visualize the GCN performance.
k. Implement the hybrid-model two.
l. Train the hybrid-model
m. Evaluate the hybrid-model.
-. Implement evaluaiton metrics: Pending are diversity, link-up rate, user hits rate. (More can be added as well)
n. Data visualization
o. Thesis report
p. Thesis presentation
q. Thesis formalities completion.

Pending approval:
a. Prestudy report.

Completed:
a. Define specification of the research problem
b. Researcy survey of Social Network Analysis
c. Deeper analysis for solution
d. Implement the S-BERT: google trans, S-BERT and cosine similarity.
e. Implementation of evaluation metrics: auroc, meanavg, mrr, hitrate, perosnalization are done.
