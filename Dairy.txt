a. Time evolution of the network links to be considered for evaluation (similar to Verma et al.) i.e., prediction of future friends based on past friends.
b. Validation dataset to be considered for hybrid weights.

Plan ahead:
a. Go ahead and implement semantic similarity.
b. Decide on Graph based approach.
c. Implementing the evaluation metrics.
d. Prestudy report.

16th Mar

15th Mar
70% RW-GCN paper was read. Development environ such as IDE, Conda, version control were setup.

10th Mar
9th Mar
Read 'Heterogeneous edge embeddings for Friend Recommendation' in detail, GCN, GraphSAGE, looked into the abstract of 'Evaluating Connection Quality between Two Individuals in Social Networks', 

6 March
Meeting with Gustav. Brainstorming on the problem. Decided to go ahead with semantic similarity and graph neural networks.

5rd March
a. Read more on SNAP and CS224w, anndn, nlp, ir, networkX, graph-tool, igraph.
b. Script SQL query to extract all relevant user data from sql database. Organize them into pandas dataframe. Replace links and ids with corresponding data. Then preprocess them such as lemmatize, remove stop words. I was considering to perform POS tagging and keep only nouns and verbs of the user. 

c. Then using NetworkX or SNAP software library create nodes for each user. Then, using connection details. create network graph. Not decided on directed or undirected graph.

c. (2nd Mar) Read the paper 'Heterogeneous Edge Embedding for Friend Recommendation. I decided to go with heterogeneous network with users node and activity node involved. Not sure to have one-link or multi-link connection between nodes. And also, read about information retrieval basics. 

d.  (3rd Mar) Python code to get into SQL data. Perform SQL query. DBeaver is the chosen SQL visualizer. We have 113K user nodes with over 1 million friendship links. SQL data handling is new to me.
